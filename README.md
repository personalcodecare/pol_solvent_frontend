# About

The Decision Duel platform is a blockchain-based gaming environment where players can compete in PvP (Player vs. Player) games, specifically a best of three series of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The platform is designed to operate across multiple devices, including PC, tablet, and mobile, ensuring a seamless user experience through a responsive web interface. Players use SV tokens to wager on games, which are settled on the Immutable zkEVM blockchain, ensuring transparent and secure transaction processing. They initially fund their wallets on the Ethereum mainnet and bridge their tokens to Immutable once they intend to play the game, this is defined in such a manner that the SV token has liquidity on the Ethereum mainnet.

- NVM (Node Version Manager) - Recommended: We recommend using NVM for managing Node.js versions. It allows you to easily switch between different versions of Node.js and ensure compatibility across different development environments. You can find installation instructions and more details on the NVM [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Getting Started
